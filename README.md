Common issues
Unable to connect to motor stage
Open Device Manager, and under Ports, look for "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COM2)". If the device doesn't show up, restart and replug the motor stage. If it shows up in the list but isn't on COM2, go to Properties->Port Settings->Advanced and switch it.
